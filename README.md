# Spatial-Temporal-Final-Coursework
Final assignment for UCL CASA Spatial-Temporal Data Analysis and Data Mining

Assignment involved creating a model to predict traffic congestion along several London streets. Using timestamp data of 5 minute increments, a machine learning model (random forest regression) was developed to use 23 days of data to predict the travel times of the remaining seven days in 5 minute increments for 18 different road segments.

Thus, 18 seperate models were developed through cross validation. All models and charts were developed in Python and presented in iPython notebooks. 

Initial spatial-temporal autocorrelation analysis was performed in R. The autocorrelation script was presented as an R Markdown document.
